### You can confidently tackle many of the problems faced by your team without support, although you may still need support with more complex, challenging items or in certain technologies that you don't know so well.

- You can take the lead and provide solid technical solutions to the majority of the tasks in your teams backlog.
- You are able to lead less experienced members of your team through tasks, delivering them effectively and to a high standard.
- You provide valuable support to more senior team members in working through a complex technical task, demonstrating an understanding of the problem and ability to contribute effectively when applying the solution.

### You are strong enough in some areas to be providing valuable support to others in your team.

- You are able to onboard new starts to your team in several technical areas, explaining technical choices, problem areas and suggest learning materials to assist ramp up.
- You are the point person for a particular technology, service, feature or process within your team.
- You can confidently speak about team activities and goals at a stakeholder review.
- You help guide other team members through work in certain technologies/languages/services, where they are less experienced or confident than you.

### You will take ownership of certain tools/systems/processes within your team.

- You can represent your team confidently in cross-team discussions (e.g. 1921 scaling sessions, inter-team alignment meetings, swarms etc.). In some instances you may take responsibility for setting up and running these sessions. Relevant examples include: platform-wide load-testing, GDPR data deletion, guilds or working groups etc.
- You facilitate team ceremonials, e.g. retros, planning, stand-ups, including management of actions.
- You have a detailed understanding of a feature or area of the codebase that has allowed you to take ownership of it, identifying and documenting tech debt, onboarding others to the codebase etc.
You have successfully presented on topics to a wider audience (i.e. beyond your team), e.g. stakeholder reviews, Friday Demos, Engineering All-Hands.


### You consider the long-term view when delivering a task, through consistent application of engineering good practice.

- When beginning a new task you lead conversation on testing approach, requirements for logging, monitoring, alerting, documentation, to ensure code is robust, resilient and can be understood by others.
- You show evidence that you are considering long-term scalability of a feature or application that you're designing, but avoid unnecessary gold-plating.
- You look for opportunities to reduce  tech debt and incrementally improve the codebase when making changes to an existing project, even if those improvements are not strictly required as part of the task you're working on.

### You actively identify ways your team might improve, and help implement those ideas.

- You suggest improvements to process at retrospectives and post mortems and help the team apply the relevant changes, or you take the ideas of others and look for ways to apply the corresponding actions.
- You use the 20% "true north" time to identify technical debt and drive the team to tackle the debt.
- You are monitoring performance dashboards, raising concerns, or areas for potential optimization with your team.
- You identify opportunities to optimise or improve services or areas of the codebase that align with your learning objectives, and use learning time to progress with this work.

### You're consistently making valuable contributions to all aspects of team discussion.

- You suggest improvements to process at retrospectives and post mortems.
- You provide input during planning and ticket estimation, e.g. clarifying areas of potential complexity, asking relevant questions, answering others questions etc.
- During pairing/mobbing sessions, you regularly put forward ideas, challenge the thoughts of others and ask questions to show engagement and understanding and to help deliver the best possible outcome.
- You are active in responding to questions put to your team from outside, e.g. from other delivery teams, from CS etc.
