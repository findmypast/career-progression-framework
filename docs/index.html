                        Our career progression framework outlines the behaviours and expectations for each level within your discipline, along
                        with example criteria to support each statement. For each level, we expect you to build on top of the previous level’s
                        requirements.

                        We know that every employee has their own ways of working, so take the examples as a guide. You can use your 1-to-1
                        meetings with your line manager to align on expectations, so we can support your career development in a way that’s
                        tailored to you.
