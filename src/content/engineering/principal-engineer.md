### You can lead a team confidently through all phases of any project/initiative they are assigned to.

- You can take a difficult technical challenge and efficiently lead a team through the design phase, drive decision making, support the creation of a backlog and lead the team confidently into the implementation phase.
- You can confidently lead on the creation of architectural proposals and refine these designs based on feedback.
- You are able to support Product and management with the production of project-level estimates/timelines.
- You can solve technical problems and lead the successful implementation of tasks others on your team may struggle with.

### You'll be a go-to person, across the wider engineering team and beyond, for certain technologies/processes and helping solve the most challenging problems.

- You provide support to help a team solve a specific challenge which they're struggling with, in a domain or technology in which you have particular knowledge.
- You provide insightful feedback to architectural proposals, helping teams shape their ideas/designs.

### You can identify even more complex problems, at a team or organisational level, propose solutions and take a lead role in ensuring appropriate action is taken.

- You are aware of a problem in a service not owned by you or your team, but you do have a potential solution in mind. You work with the owning team to implement that solution.
- Identifying a gap in a team's processes, e.g. with regards to code review, testing, alerting, issues with sub-optimal queries etc. and proposing a solution, potentially involving introduction of a new technology, tool or practice to drive the required improvement.

### You are ensuring all tools/systems/ processes important to the work of your team are being actively owned within the team.

- You take action to monitor the state of all services your team owns, e.g. reviewing the state of documentation, dashboards, alerts, service performance etc. This may involve you delegating responsibility for services to others within the team, but you are actively ensuring the teams responsibilities are being managed.
- You are working with Product, Design and other stakeholders to ensure they are getting the engineering support they need, e.g. grooming backlog, ticket refinement, estimations etc.
- You are taking action to improve specific practices within your team, e.g. improving test coverage through mentoring, addition of test libraries/frameworks, documenting testing guidelines etc. 
- You are active in managing technical debt within the services and platforms owned by your team. You may work with the PO to ensure necessary work to optimise and improve these areas is being prioritised.
- You ensure remedial work coming out of incident post-mortems is being prioritised and implemented according to required timelines.

### You help ensure your team is focused on delivering against stakeholder expectations and can communicate confidently with stakeholders when needed.

- You support the PO in defining epic or project-level estimations, tracking progress against those estimates over time and communicating with stakeholders on progress over time.

### You'll play an important role in defining long-term technical strategy at team level, and sometimes in a wider context.

- You are actively managing your teams technical roadmap, ensuring it's up-to-date and shared with Product and other stakeholders to ensure critical technical work is built into the overall team roadmap alongside Product work.
- You work to ensure your area of the platform is well-maintained and future-proofed. This may involve leading discussions/workshops with your team (and other experts) to refine technical plans.

### You'll be supporting the development of others, at any level, within or outside your team.

- You are mentoring one or more engineers in technologies you are strong in.
- You are regularly working with less experienced engineers on complex tasks, helping them learn through practical experience.
- You share your learnings, using suitable means to do so: e.g. team-wide learning demos, discourse post, tech blog post etc.

### Your learning will include a focus on advanced specialism and latest developments in particular technologies.

- Learnings will focus on areas not currently used by your team but which offer potential strategic value in terms of delivering on the long-term roadmap of the team.
- You have developed working knowledge in an area outside of the core platform/tech-stack in order to deliver an effective solution to an important business problem, e.g. ML/AI techniques, AWS/cloud technologies etc.
- Your skill-level in a valued specialism makes you a go-to person to support complex work in that area, e.g. CSS/HTML, Database Administration, Kubernetes, and you work to maintain your expertise in that area.
